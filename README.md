# pisang
Pisang is fun. This is a simple interpreter, just for fun, hobby and upskilling.

## How to build
Please use this command to build Pisang to your machine
```
  make buildexec
```

## Current working syntax
```
PROGRAM <your program name>;
BEGIN
  <expression>;
END.
```
Yeah I know this is still needing semicolon and flying old-style Pascal-like. Anyway, if you're interested to contribute please create an issues then fork it.
Please see `bin/sample.pi`

## To do 
1. Unary operator
2. Tidying the codes
3. Argparse
4. Procedure/function
5. Adding abstract syntax tree (AST)
6. Variable type declaration
7. Other primitive types (currently I'm only working on integer data type)
... (will be updated soon)
